GraphQL API with Java Spring Boot & Spring Framework


Tool - Altair graphql client -- to test graphql api

to change graphql default url to http://localhost:8080/graphql to http://localhost:8080/app-ui (add below in application properties)

#by default /graphiql
graphiql.mapping=/app-ui

#by default /graphql
graphql.servlet.mapping=/student-service


Normally we use resolver by extending graphqlresolver
but now we can use controller as resolver by mentioning that controller as @controller.
and we need to use @querymapping (for graphql query) @mutationmapping (for graphql mutation)

spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled = true  if u add this property then you will get http://localhost:9091/graphiql
in postman http://localhost:9091/graphql use this to test.
